# 📖 Overview

This project is part of **Generative AI Lab-4**, where multiple NLP models are implemented to generate text from a custom AI-related dataset.

The lab progresses through three major approaches:

✅ N-Gram Statistical Language Model
✅ RNN Neural Text Generator
✅ Transformer-Based Text Generator

The goal is to understand how language models evolve from simple probability-based prediction to modern attention-based architectures.

## 🔹 N-Gram Model

Basic probabilistic approach:

* Predicts next word using previous word
* Uses dictionary mapping
* No deep learning

### ⚠️ Limitations

* Short context memory
* Repetitive outputs
* No semantic understanding

## 🔹 RNN Text Generation

Neural network architecture:

```
Embedding → SimpleRNN → Dense Softmax
```

Key Features:

* Learns sequence patterns
* Better coherence than N-Gram
* 100 Training Epochs
